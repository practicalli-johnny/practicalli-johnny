My career includes large organisations (Citi, Salesforce) and early to late stage startups within Fintech and Data Science companies.  Most recently working with a Berlin Fintech startup as a Machine Learning Platform Architect, developing data transformation services as well as evolving organisational engineering practices and devops workflows. 

I am the founder of [Practicalli](https://practical.li) which provides community educational resources for software engineering, with a focus on Clojure and ClojureScript.  The work is done in personal time and includes [freely available videos and books on Clojure and ClojureScript development](https://practical.li/), guiding those interested in building services with the powerful, elegant and fun Clojure language.

I have invested time over the last decade to supporting people in the London developer community as well as many online communities.  I have had the pleasure of organising many hundreds of events for the [London Clojurians community](https://londonclojurians.org/).  I've also helped run 12 [ClojureBridge London](https://clojurebridgelondon.github.io/) events, which supports people from under-represented groups start their journey into the software industry. 

In my spare time I love to cycle and in 2019 I cycled 1,000 miles (1,600km) across Britain in 9 days and raise thousands of pounds for charity.
