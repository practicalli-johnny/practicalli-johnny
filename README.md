I am the founder of [Practicalli](https://practical.li) which provides community educational resources for software engineering, with a focus on Clojure and common development tooling.  The work is done in personal time and includes [freely available videos and books on Clojure and ClojureScript development](https://practical.li/), guiding those interested in building services with the powerful, elegant and fun Clojure language.

I have learned a great deal whilst investing time over the last decade to supporting people in the London developer community as well as many online communities.  I have had the pleasure of organising many hundreds of events for the [London Clojurians community](https://londonclojurians.org/).  I've also helped run 12 [ClojureBridge London](https://clojurebridgelondon.github.io/) events, supporting people from under-represented groups as they start their journey into the software industry. 

In my spare time I love to cycle and in 2019 I cycled 1,000 miles (1,600km) across Britain in 9 days and raise thousands of pounds for charity.
