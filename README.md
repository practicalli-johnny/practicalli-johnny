# Welcome
I am [a software engineer with a wide range of experiences](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jr0cket/), with commercial Clojure experience since 2017 and mostly JVM experience from 1997.  I have carried out consultancy, training, product development, technical team management, advocacy, tech writing and support roles during my career.

December 2022 I concluded a role at [Billie.io](https://billie.io) as a Clojure Engineer & Machine Learning Architect, supporting the data science teams with tools and services as well as evolving engineering practices and development workflows.

I am the founder of [Practicalli](https://practical.li), which provides community resources for learning and applying Clojure (and ClojureScript).  This work is largely done in personal time, with several projects focused on creating [freely available videos and books on Clojure and ClojureScript development](https://practical.li/), guiding those interested in building services with the powerful, elegant and fun Clojure language.

I have invested time over the last decade to supporting people in the London developer community as well as many online communities.  I have had the pleasure of organising many hundreds of events for the [London Clojurians community](https://londonclojurians.org/).  I've also helped run 12 [ClojureBridge London](https://clojurebridgelondon.github.io/) events, which supports people from under-represented groups start their journey into the software industry. 

In my spare time I love to cycle and in 2019 I cycled 1,000 miles (1,600km) across Britain in 9 days.
